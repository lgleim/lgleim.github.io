In my role as Senior R&D Engineer and Technical Planner at the Huawei Cloud Research Center Munich, I built up and developed the technical roadmap for a new team developing key services in the context of the Huawei Cloud Robotics initiative, focusing on the area of data management and simulation. 
As such, I have been responsible for market analysis, strategic technology & roadmap planning (including academic and commercial alliances), and proof-of-concept implementation of cloud-native solutions for robotics towards a data and simulation platform for SimDevOps: Develop, train, and test robotic & AI solutions in simulation, deploy to & monitor real world systems from the Cloud and feed back monitoring data and observations for refinement in a continuous process.
My contributions have been awarded with three Huawei top performance awards (2021, 2022, 2023).

Peviously, I was a researcher in computer science at the Chair of Databases and Information Systems of RWTH Aachen University.
There my work focused on continuous interorganizational data exchange & integration along the value chain from design, manufacturing, operation, all the way to recycling.
