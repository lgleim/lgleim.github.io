In my role as Senior R&D Engineer and Technical Planner at the Huawei Cloud Research Center Munich, I built up and developed the technical roadmap for a new team developing key services in the context of the Huawei Cloud Robotics initiative, focusing on the area of data management and simulation. 
As such, I have been responsible for market analysis, strategic technology & roadmap planning (including academic and commercial alliances), and proof-of-concept implementation of cloud-native solutions for robotics towards a data and simulation platform for SimDevOps: Develop, train, and test robotic & AI solutions in simulation, deploy to & monitor real world systems from the Cloud and feed back monitoring data and observations for refinement in a continuous process.
My contributions have been awarded with three Huawei top performance awards (2021, 2022, 2023).

Peviously, I was a researcher in computer science at the Chair of Databases and Information Systems of RWTH Aachen University.
There my work focused on continuous interorganizational data exchange & integration along the value chain from design, manufacturing, operation, all the way to recycling.
Adapting Semantic Web Technologies for the creation of integrated, distributed, versioned and auditable knowledegraphs of IIoT and business data, providing the foundation for AI and reliable distributed processes in the [Internet of Production](https://iop.rwth-aachen.de) and Industry 4.0 in general.
